In this post I will explore and visualize some approaches.\nSide note: why hex-based grid? Because it gives smooth naturally-looking areas compared to square or rectangle grids for example.\nFlood fill This is the simplest approach which comes to mind first. The idea is:\ninitialize areas by picking some random points; iterate over areas and expand them to neighboring points (apply flood-fill algorithm); Depending on the order of iteration over areas and how we pick a point to expand, we\u0026rsquo;ll get different results.\nFully random On each step we pick a random area and expand it to random point:\nThis gives nicely looking results, with ripped edges. But due to fully random nature, one area can expand way more than others and produce weirdly-looking protrusions.\nIterate over areas and expand to nearest point This is the opposite approach that reduces randomness:\ncircularly iterate over all areas (to give every area equal chance to grow); expand each area to the point nearest to the initial point; This gives roundish look. But due to heavy restrictions on how to expand the areas, we can get long protrusions which ruin the entire picture. The easiest way to remove them is to re-generate the layout.\nCombined? It seems that combination of iterative and fully random floodfill will give us a good result, but how can we combine them? The expantion of areas should be random to avoid round shapes. Looping over areas is actually the same as picking random area, because random number generator should give roughly equal amount of every index.\nPossible improvements:\nadd weights to areas to tweak RNG; add weights to expansion points; or implement an analyzer of the produced result and re-generate the layout if the quality is too low; \u0026ldquo;Voronoi\u0026rdquo; principle Another approach is to use Voronoi diagrams: every point belongs to the area which initial point is the closest.\nThe generic solution for Voronoi diagrams on a plane is quite complex, but for grids it\u0026rsquo;s quite simple: iterate over all points of the grid, compute distances to all initial points and pick the minimum.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it looks with \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; approach:\nLooks geometric, definitely not natural. But still may be useful.\nManhattan distance A way to make it look less geometric is to use a different distance function, for example ManHattan distance. This gives way more stylish result:\nDiagonal borders match the hexagon grid nicely.\nInitial points selection Typically, initial points should be defined by underlying logic of the map/grid, but for this post I pick random points.\nOne approach is to take fully random non-overlapping points. This may result in points located close to each other, which may lead to weird generation results: small areas or long protrusions.\nA better approach is to use \u0026ldquo;best candidate\u0026rdquo; algorithm:\nfor each point generate N candidates; select the candidate that maximazes the minimum distance to already generated points; This will give points which are distant from each other.\nReferences Overview of hex grids: orientation, coordinates, etc. I took the idea of ManHattan distance for Voronoi diagram from this article on Habr.

The most interesting part is that the return type doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be the same.\nCovariant types This trick is called Covariant return types:\nIf the function Derived::f overrides a function Base::f, their return types must either be the same or be covariant. Two types are covariant if they satisfy all of the following requirements:\nboth types are pointers or references (lvalue or rvalue) to classes. Multi-level pointers or references are not allowed. the referenced/pointed-to class in the return type of Base::f() must be an unambiguous and accessible direct or indirect base class of the referenced/pointed-to class of the return type of Derived::f(). the return type of Derived::f() must be equally or less cv-qualified than the return type of Base::f(). In the example above both A* and B* are pointers, A is a base class of B, and A* and B* have the same cv-qualifiers. So, they\u0026rsquo;re coveriant types, and Derived::bar overrides virtual Base::bar method.\nEven more, Base::bar may change the return type to const A*, and everything will continue to work (because B* is less cv-qualified than const A*).\nclass Base { public: virtual const A* bar() { return \u0026amp;a; } private: A a; }; class Derived: public Base { public: // return type is different B* bar() override { return \u0026amp;b; } private: B b; }; Notes I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen this trick in production code since then, so its usefulness is questionable.\nPotentially, it can be used to get the implementation of the interface from the interface itself in places where the implementation class is accessible.\n","permalink":"https://andreynautilus.github.io/posts/2025-05-01-covariant-return-types/","summary":"Return types of methods-overrides may be different","title":"Covariant types in C++ virtual methods"},{"content":"I came across the following piece of C++ code:\nconst std::uint8_t mask = 0x06; std::uint8_t value = foo(); if (mask \u0026amp; ~value) { // do something } and SonarQube scan emitted a warning for this code:\nif (mask \u0026amp; ~value) { ^~~~~~~~~~~~~ Do not apply \u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026#34; bitwise operator to a signed operand. But, both mask and value are unsigned, so where does the signed operand come from?\nIntegral promotion C++ language allows implicit conversion of integral types in some cases, this is called Integral promotion:\nprvalues of small integral types (such as char) and unscoped enumeration types may be converted to prvalues of larger integral types (such as int). In particular, arithmetic operators do not accept types smaller than int as arguments, and integral promotions are automatically applied after lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, if applicable. This conversion always preserves the value.\nAnd bitwise NOT - ~ - is an arithmetic operator, so it will involve integral promotion:\nIf the operand passed to a built-in arithmetic operator is integral or unscoped enumeration type, then before any other action (but after lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, if applicable), the operand undergoes integral promotion.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s what happens:\nvalue is promoted to int; bitwise ~ operator is applied to value producing int; mask is promoted to int; bitwise \u0026amp; operator is called with two ints; That\u0026rsquo;s where signed operand comes from.\nInterestingly, explicit cast of ~value to std::uint8_t via static_cast\u0026lt;std::uint8_t\u0026gt;(~value) silences the SonarQube warning (but does not remove the promotion).\nCompiler Explorer gives the expected result:\nsizeof(value)=1 sizeof(~value)=4 sizeof(mask \u0026amp; ~value)=4 typeid(~value)=i So, be careful with arithmetic operators when applied to \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; integer types.\n","permalink":"https://andreynautilus.github.io/posts/2025-04-24-mysterious-signed-operand/","summary":"Integral promotion in action","title":"Mysterious signed operand in a C++ expression"},{"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s look at a simple C++ program:\n#include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;unordered_set\u0026gt; void print(const std::unordered_set\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\u0026amp; s) { for (const auto\u0026amp; n : s) { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; n \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39; \u0026#39;; } std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; } int main() { const std::unordered_set\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // construct a set print(s); const std::unordered_set\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s_1{s}; // copy the set print(s_1); return 0; } What will be the output of this program? Well, it depends on the STL implementation, because it\u0026rsquo;s unspecified by the standard.\n3 different types of behaviour C++ standard defines 3 types of behaviour:\nundefined behaviour: the standard gives no guarantees, anything can happen. The program may behave differently between different runs; even \u0026ldquo;your computer may explode\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s why it is one of the scariest beasts in C++. unspecified behaviour: the standard delegates the guarantees to the implementation. In this case, the behaviour is defined and the program is predictable, but it may differ per implementation. implementation-defined behavior: same as \u0026ldquo;unspecified behaviour\u0026rdquo;, but the implementation must document it. The copy constructor of std::unordered_set doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify the order of elements in the copy (because it\u0026rsquo;s unordered set), so every STL implementation may behave differently. It is unspecified behaviour.\nAssumptions are wrong Let\u0026rsquo;s make an experiment and compile this program with gcc and clang and see the output:\nclang++ -std=c++14 main.cpp -o main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./main g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp -o main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./main I use GodBolt Compiler Explorer for this. The page shows the output for gcc-14.2 and clang-19.1.0 (latest), and gcc-6.5 and clang-5.0.1 (some old versions). In all cases the output is similar: both lines print(s) and print(s_1) produce the same output.\nThis gives us an assumption that copy constructor simply copies the underlying data structure and preserves the order of elements. But this is wrong.\nMacOS Let\u0026rsquo;s switch to MacOS and XCode. XCode uses a dedicated apple-clang compiler and MacOS SDK provides the STL implementation. Let\u0026rsquo;s compile and run the same program (tested on XCode-15.0.1 with MacOS SDK 14.0 and XCode-15.3 with MacOS SDK 14.4):\nclang++ -std=c++14 main.cpp -o main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./main 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 Wow, the order of elements has changed. Looking into STL sources we\u0026rsquo;ll see that copy constructor inserts elements of the original set into the copy:\ntemplate \u0026lt;class _Value, class _Hash, class _Pred, class _Alloc\u0026gt; unordered_set\u0026lt;_Value, _Hash, _Pred, _Alloc\u0026gt;::unordered_set( const unordered_set\u0026amp; __u) : __table_(__u.__table_) { _VSTD::__debug_db_insert_c(this); __table_.__rehash_unique(__u.bucket_count()); insert(__u.begin(), __u.end()); } This might explain the change. Let\u0026rsquo;s extend our program and copy the set a few more times:\nint main() { const std::unordered_set\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // construct a set print(s); const std::unordered_set\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s_1{s}; // copy the set print(s_1); const std::unordered_set\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s_2{s_1}; // copy the set print(s_2); const std::unordered_set\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s_3{s_2}; // copy the set print(s_3); return 0; } Compile and run it:\nclang++ -std=c++14 main.cpp -o main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./main 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 The order of elements changes every time the set is copied. And that\u0026rsquo;s perfectly valid according to the standard, and this proves that the original assumption was wrong.\nConclusion Never assume an unspecified behaviour, even if everything seems reasonable and some experiments prove the assumption. The assumption itself may be wrong and any change to the setup may break it and thus break the program.\nThe history behind the story There was a collection defined as\nstruct Collection { std::unordered_set\u0026lt;std::vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\u0026gt; unique_ids; } This collection used deep copy in copy-constructor, so every time the object is copied, the underlying unordered_set is also copied (which caused the vectors to be re-ordered on MacOS). This collection also implemented an iterator interface (as vector iterator), and this object was used to construct a vector from begin and end iterators.\nEverything worked fine until XCode got updated from 15.0.1 to 15.3, which caused MacOS SDK to be updated from 14.0 to 14.4, which updated STL implementation. std::vector constructor started to copy input iterators less times, which caused the Collection object (as iterator) to be copied even (not odd) amount of times, so the unordered_set is copied even amount of times and its elements got re-ordered. That broke the construction of the resulting vector.\nLuckily there was a unittest that started to fail and allowed to debug and find this bug.\n","permalink":"https://andreynautilus.github.io/posts/2024-12-28-unordered-set-xcode/","summary":"Unspecified behaviour may vary between different STL implementations","title":"Unspecified behaviour in std::unordered_set and MacOS SDK"},{"content":"In some setups we want to have a global .gitignore configuration for all repositories for a user:\nrepositories don\u0026rsquo;t have proper .gitignore file; you want to use a tool or IDE that creates temporary files, which are not ignored by the existing .gitignore file; It\u0026rsquo;s possible to configure local gitignore rules via .git/info/exclude file in a repository, but then the configuration has to be copied to all repos.

There could be at most 1 point in any grid cell. The value of a cell is either an index of a generated point or -1.\nThe algorithm:\ninitialize the grid that covers the requested area with -1 in each cell; generate an initial point p0 and set the corresponding grid cell to 0 (the first point); initialize a list of active points with index 0; pick a random index from active points (let\u0026rsquo;s say p-i). Generate up to k random points in annulus between r and 2r form the selected point p-i; test every generated point if it\u0026rsquo;s far enough (dist \u0026gt;=r) from already existing points (use the grid to test only nearby cells); if a generated point is far enough from all existing points, add it to the list of generated points, update the grid cell with its index and add this new point to active points; if all k points are too close to already existing points, then remove p-i from active points; repeat until list of active points is empty; Side notes:\ncomplexity is O(N); easy to implement; the cluster of points grows naturally from the starting point to all directions; easily extensible to 3D (and more dimensional) space; the number of points is not known until the generation process is complete (it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;generate some points with specific condition\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;generate N points\u0026rdquo;); Other options There are other ways to generate evenly distributed random points (see this blog post):\nuse noise; Lloyd\u0026rsquo;s relaxation: apply a few iterations of Lloyd algorithm to move points away from each other; Links https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1830-jittered-grid/ https://www.jasondavies.com/poisson-disc/ ","permalink":"https://andreynautilus.github.io/posts/2024-07-21-evenly-random-points-on-plane/","summary":"Bridson’s Algorithm to build Poisson disk distribution of points","title":"Evenly distributed random points"},{"content":"Linux has multiple values that represent the amount of memory associated with a process:\nRSS or Resident Set Size or RES - total amount of physical memory associated with the process including all shared libraries.

Official documentation has a bit more detailed explanation, but in simple words:\n--force-with-lease will not allow you to override someones changes that were not pulled to your local copy.\nAs a rule of thumb: always use --force-with-lease unless you have very good reasons to use --force.\nDanger zone If after re-writing your local history, but before pushing the changes to remote, you update your local remote-tracking branches (with git fetch for example), --force-with-lease will not save you from overriding others changes. In this case git assumes that\u0026rsquo;s your intention to override someones changes.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s simulate this scenario locally, I\u0026rsquo;ll use fixup commits as example. git can use a local repository as remote (I\u0026rsquo;ll use bare repository for this). We\u0026rsquo;re interested in commits, not the actual changes, so all commits will be empty (done with --allow-empty flag).\nInitial setup First, let\u0026rsquo;s create a remote (a bare git repository):\n$ mkdir remote $ cd remote remote $ git init --bare Mr.Green clones the repository, configures the user, initializes the main branch with an empty commit and pushes it to the remote:\n$ mkdir green $ git clone remote green $ cd green green $ git config --local user.name \u0026#34;Alex Green\u0026#34; green $ git config --local user.email \u0026#34;alex.green@address.com\u0026#34; green $ git commit -m \u0026#34;initial commit\u0026#34; --allow-empty green $ git push origin main Next, his co-worker, Mr.Red clones the repository and configures his user:\n$ mkdir red $ git clone remote red $ cd red red $ git config --local user.name \u0026#34;Bob Red\u0026#34; red $ git config --local user.email \u0026#34;bob.red@address.com\u0026#34; Now we have 2 clones from different people of the same remote.\nCreating a conflict Mr.Red creates a branch, makes a few changes and pushes the branch to the remote:\nred $ git checkout -b feature_branch red $ git commit -m \u0026#34;change from Red 1\u0026#34; --allow-empty red $ git commit --fixup HEAD --allow-empty red $ git push --set-upstream origin feature_branch Mr.Red invites his co-worker - Mr.Green - to help. Mr.Green checks out feature_branch, makes some changes and pushes the branch back to remote:\ngreen $ git pull green $ git checkout feature_branch green $ git commit -m \u0026#34;change from Green 1\u0026#34; --allow-empty green $ git push origin feature_branch In the meanwhile, Mr.Red continues to make changes. When ready, he squashes the changes to produce a \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; history for the review process:\nred $ git commit --fixup HEAD~1 --allow-empty red $ git rebase --autosquash --interactive HEAD~3 # accept all changes Boom! Now the git history in Mr.Reds local copy has a conflict with the remote (what Mr.Green pushed):\nred $ git log --oneline feature_branch 266b934 (HEAD -\u0026gt; feature_branch) change from Red 1 71737b9 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) initial commit green $ git log --oneline feature_branch fa25da6 (HEAD -\u0026gt; feature_branch, origin/feature_branch) change from Green 1 c905bcf fixup! change from Red 1 863c570 change from Red 1 71737b9 (origin/main, main) initial commit (note the commit hashes!)\nHandling the conflict Mr.Red re-wrote the history of his branch, and if he tries to git push, the operation will fail. Mr.Red knows that he needs to force-push in order to send his branch to the remote.\nMr.Red might not be aware of the changes from Mr.Green, so using git push --force will override the commit from Mr.Green. --force-with-lease prevents it:\nred $ git push origin feature_branch --force-with-lease To C:/Projects/git_push_force_example/remote ! [rejected] feature_branch -\u0026gt; feature_branch (stale info) error: failed to push some refs to \u0026#39;C:/Projects/git_push_force_example/remote\u0026#39; Voila! Mr.Red didn\u0026rsquo;t override someones commit and needs to rebase and re-apply his changes.\nDanger zone If Mr.Red updates his local remote-tracking branches (with git fetch):\nred $ git log --oneline origin/feature_branch c905bcf (origin/feature_branch) fixup! change from Red 1 863c570 change from Red 1 71737b9 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) initial commit red $ git fetch red $ git log --oneline origin/feature_branch fa25da6 (origin/feature_branch) change from Green 1 c905bcf fixup! change from Red 1 863c570 change from Red 1 71737b9 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) initial commit the push operation will succeed and it will override the commit from Mr.Green on the remote. This happens, because git fetch brings the commit from Mr.Green to the local copy of Mr.Red, and git assumes that Mr.Red actually wants to override the commit from Mr.Green.\nConclusion Always prefer git push --force-with-lease over git push --force and use git fetch consciously.\n","permalink":"https://andreynautilus.github.io/posts/2024-05-16-git-force-vs-force-with-lease/","summary":"Prefer \u0026lsquo;git push \u0026ndash;force-with-lease\u0026rsquo; over \u0026lsquo;git push \u0026ndash;force\u0026rsquo;","title":"git push --force vs --force-with-lease"},{"content":"Tools https://regex101.com/ - online RegEx tester/debugger https://crontab.guru/ - cron explainer https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github - browser extension to greatly enrich GitHub UI https://ohshitgit.com/ - git cheatsheet for \u0026ldquo;shit happened\u0026rdquo; cases Bash scripting docs: conditions and vars expansion Procedural generation https://www.boristhebrave.com/ : Diablo 1 dungeon generation, unExplored dungeon generation, etc. https://www.redblobgames.com/ : map generation from noise and from polygons, random polyline between 2 points and lots of useful links.
