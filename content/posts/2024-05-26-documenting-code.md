Summary of ["My 3 Rules for Documenting Code" article](https://dev.to/wraith/my-3-rules-for-documenting-code-2f54).

1. **Names** (classes, variables, functions) should explain _**What**_ (what is it? what does this function do?).
1. **Code** should explain _**How**_ (how is it implemented?).
1. **Comments** should explain _**Why**_ (why is it implemented this way?).

Added to the [Collection of links](../../links).
